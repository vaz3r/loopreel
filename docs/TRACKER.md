# Loopreel V1 Issue Tracker & Milestones

> **For AI Agents:** Update this file whenever you start (`[/]`), complete (`[x]`), or block (`[-]`) a task. This acts as the Jira board for the project.

## Milestones

- **Phase 0: Scaffolding (COMPLETE)** — Setup monorepo, Turborepo, Postgres schema, Redis, and basic package boundaries.
- **Phase 1: Pipelines (COMPLETE)** — Build `worker-ingest`, `worker-transcribe`, `worker-structure`, `worker-render`, and the `worker-relay`. Connect them via `api`.
- **Phase 2: Polish (CURRENT)** — Add Observability (Pino), Error Handling (heartbeats, TTL sweeps), and write Testcontainers integration tests.

## Context & Recent Decisions Log
*When making significant architectural choices during coding, log them here for the next agent to read.*

- **2026-07-17:** Converted docs to a strict V1 AI-agent format. Extracted Outbox Relay into a standalone `worker-relay` microservice. Mandated Playwright TTLs and Idempotency checks. Locked in Turborepo for monorepo orchestration.
- **2026-07-17:** Phase 0 scaffolding complete. pnpm@11.13.1, Node 24.18.0, TypeScript strict mode. All 11 packages build and typecheck clean. Docker Compose defines full stack with `full` profile for app services.
- **2026-07-17:** E04 worker-relay complete. Outbox polling with `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`, BullMQ dispatch per queue, pino logging, concurrency guard. E05 API routes complete. POST /api/jobs with Zod validation + transactional outbox, GET /api/jobs/:id with assets, GET /api/health with DB + worker checks, GET /render/:jobId/:slideIndex with 127.0.0.1 guard.
- **2026-07-17:** E06-E09 workers complete. worker-ingest (cheerio blog scrape), worker-transcribe (Whisper HTTP), worker-structure (DeepSeek LLM + Zod validation), worker-render (Playwright pool + R2 upload). All workers have idempotency checks, error classification, and pino logging. End-to-end test passed: API creates job → relay dispatches ingest → ingest scrapes blog → relay dispatches structure → structure calls LLM (401 without API key, correctly marked failed). Full pipeline plumbing verified.
- **2026-07-18:** Phase 2 gap fixes complete. Created 3 new packages: `@loopreel/llm` (OpenRouter + retry), `@loopreel/templates` (v1 prompts + versioning), `@loopreel/errors` (shared classification). Fixed browser pool inUse tracking, worker-structure concurrency (1→10), health route (Redis check), relay (FOR UPDATE inside TX), all workers (heartbeats, SIGTERM cleanup). Added Puppeteer fallback for blogs, download endpoint, metrics sidecar, TTL sweeper, Swagger docs. All 7 Dockerfiles created. Full end-to-end test: blog → cheerio scrape → OpenRouter LLM → 9 slides generated → job reached "rendering" state.
